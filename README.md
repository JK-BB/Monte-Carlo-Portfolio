## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/monte-carlo-portfolio.git
cd monte-carlo-portfolio
```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv

# Activate on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Activate on Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Quick Start

1. **Run data analysis** to download historical data and calculate parameters:
```bash
python data_analysis.py
```

This will:
- Download 5 years of S&P 500 (SPY) data
- Calculate mean daily returns and volatility
- Generate historical analysis charts
- Display drift (μ) and volatility (σ) parameters

2. **Run Monte Carlo simulation** using the calculated parameters:
```bash
python monte_carlo_simulation.py
```

This will:
- Simulate 10,000 price paths over 252 trading days (1 year)
- Generate comprehensive visualization dashboard
- Display statistical risk metrics

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Mathematical Foundation

The project implements **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**, the standard model for stock price dynamics:
```
S(t+Δt) = S(t) × exp[(μ - σ²/2)Δt + σ√Δt × Z]
```

Where:
- **S(t)** = Stock price at time t
- **μ** = Drift (expected annual return)
- **σ** = Volatility (annual standard deviation)
- **Δt** = Time step (1/252 for daily increments)
- **Z** = Random shock from standard normal distribution N(0,1)

### Parameter Estimation

**Drift (μ):**
```python
daily_returns = prices.pct_change()
mean_daily_return = daily_returns.mean()
annual_return = mean_daily_return * 252  # Annualize
```

**Volatility (σ):**
```python
daily_volatility = daily_returns.std()
annual_volatility = daily_volatility * np.sqrt(252)  # Annualize
```

### Simulation Process

1. Initialize portfolio at $10,000
2. For each of 10,000 simulations:
   - Generate 252 random daily shocks
   - Apply GBM formula to calculate daily prices
   - Store complete price path
3. Analyze distribution of final values
4. Calculate risk metrics and generate visualizations

## 📊 Understanding the Results

### Statistical Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Mean** | Average final portfolio value across all simulations |
| **Median** | Middle value (50th percentile) |
| **5th Percentile** | Worst case for 95% of scenarios (VaR proxy) |
| **95th Percentile** | Best case for 95% of scenarios |
| **Std Deviation** | Measure of outcome variability |
| **Probability of Profit** | Percentage of simulations ending above initial investment |

### Interpreting Visualizations

**Chart 1: Price Paths**
- Shows 100 sample trajectories
- Illustrates range of possible outcomes
- Demonstrates market randomness

**Chart 2: Distribution**
- Histogram of final portfolio values
- Shows most likely outcomes
- Indicates probability of different results

**Chart 3: Confidence Intervals**
- Shaded bands show range over time
- Dark band = middle 50% of outcomes
- Light band = middle 90% of outcomes
- Demonstrates growing uncertainty

**Chart 4: Return Distribution**
- Shows profit/loss percentages
- Normal distribution centered around expected return
- Visualizes risk-reward profile

## 🛠️ Customization

### Modify Simulation Parameters

Edit `monte_carlo_simulation.py`:
```python
# Change initial investment
initial_investment = 50000  # $50,000

# Change time horizon
time_horizon = 252 * 5  # 5 years instead of 1

# Change number of simulations
num_simulations = 50000  # More simulations = smoother distribution
```

### Try Different Assets

Edit `data_analysis.py`:
```python
# Change ticker symbol
ticker = yf.Ticker("AAPL")  # Apple instead of S&P 500
# or
ticker = yf.Ticker("BTC-USD")  # Bitcoin
# or
ticker = yf.Ticker("GLD")  # Gold ETF
```

### Adjust Time Period
```python
# Change historical data period
data = ticker.history(period="10y")  # 10 years instead of 5
```

## 📚 Key Concepts Explained

### What is Monte Carlo Simulation?

A computational technique that uses repeated random sampling to model complex systems with uncertainty. In finance, it's used to:
- Model investment risk
- Price complex derivatives
- Optimize portfolio allocation
- Stress test strategies

### What is Geometric Brownian Motion?

A mathematical model that assumes:
- Stock prices follow a log-normal distribution
- Returns are normally distributed
- Prices exhibit both drift (trend) and volatility (randomness)

**Real-world application:** Used by quants at hedge funds and investment banks for risk modeling.

### Why These Results Matter

- **For Investors**: Understand realistic range of outcomes, not just "average" returns
- **For Risk Management**: Quantify worst-case scenarios (5th percentile)
- **For Planning**: See how likely you are to meet financial goals
- **For Strategy**: Compare different investment approaches objectively

## ⚠️ Limitations & Assumptions

This model assumes:
- ✓ Constant drift and volatility (reality: they change over time)
- ✓ Log-normal price distribution (reality: fat tails exist)
- ✓ No transaction costs or taxes
- ✓ Continuous trading (reality: market closes)
- ✓ Independent returns (reality: autocorrelation exists)

**This is an educational tool, not investment advice.**
